# vimrc

This is my personal Vim configuration which is largly taken from other people who are far better than me at using Vim.  The bulk of my .vimrc file and general setup is borrowed with thanks from [nvie](https://github.com/nvie/vimrc)

There is still a lot of this .vimrc file that I am playing around with to help me understand Vim better.  It is a great way to learn Vim while trying to figure out what other people's Vim setup is doing.  I learnt a lot from reading nvie's 2010 post on '[How I boosted my Vim](http://nvie.com/posts/how-i-boosted-my-vim/)' - grab a coffee and a notepad and take some notes.

Other resources I used while putting my current Vim setup together were:
